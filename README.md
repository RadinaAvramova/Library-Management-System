# Library Management System in C++
Welcome to the Library Management System project in C++! This repository contains a C++ implementation of a simple library management system. The Library Management System allows librarians or administrators to manage books, patrons, and transactions within a library environment.

## Features
1. **Book Management:** Enables librarians to add, remove, search, and update book records in the library database.

2. **Patron Management:** Facilitates the management of library patrons, including adding new patrons, updating patron information, and searching for patrons.

3. **Transaction Handling:** Handles library transactions such as borrowing and returning books, tracking due dates, and managing fines for late returns.

4. **User Authentication:** Implements user authentication mechanisms to control access to administrative functionalities and ensure data security.

5. **Data Persistence:** Stores library data persistently in files or a database to maintain data integrity and enable data retrieval between sessions.

## Installation
To use the Library Management System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/Library-Management-System.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Library-Management-System

3. **Compile the Code:** Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler. For example, using g++:

g++ main.cpp -o library_management_system

4. **Run the Application:** Execute the compiled executable file to start the Library Management System:

./library_management_system

## Usage
1. **Login:** Log in to the Library Management System using valid credentials (if authentication is implemented).

2. **Menu Navigation:** Navigate through the menu options to perform various tasks such as managing books, managing patrons, and handling transactions.

3. **Book Management:** Add new books to the library, remove existing books, update book information, or search for books by title, author, or ISBN.

4. **Patron Management:** Add new patrons to the library database, update patron information, or search for patrons by name or ID.

5. **Transaction Handling:** Borrow books for patrons, return borrowed books, and manage due dates and fines for late returns.

6. **Data Persistence:** Ensure that changes made to the library database are saved persistently to maintain data integrity.

## Customization
1. **User Interface:** Customize the user interface of the Library Management System to improve usability and match specific requirements.

2. **Database Integration:** Integrate the system with a database management system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) for more efficient data storage and retrieval.

3. **Additional Features:** Extend the functionality of the system with features such as book reservations, inter-library loans, or advanced search capabilities.
